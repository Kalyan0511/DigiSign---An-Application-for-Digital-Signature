# DigiSign---An-Application-for-Digital-Signature

This project is the implementation of an application called “DigiSign” which allows its users to request for a digital signature from other users, and the users can also sign the documents which are requested by others.

Every user has to first sign up into the application with the required details and then can log in into the application.

The users can check the status of the requested documents and also verify whether the signature is authentic or not.
